### Context:
We had five days to complete this project. It was assigned during the second week of module 1 at the Turing School of Software and Design. It took us 55 person-hours of work to complete through iteration 3. Our goal was to work collaboratively to write Javascript to allow the user to show a random romance cover, save a cover, view those saved covers, and create their own.
